# Sales Data Analysis & RFM Segmentation

This project explores a retail sales dataset through data cleaning, visualization, and customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) modeling.

## 📊 Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess the raw sales dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize trends and patterns in customer behavior
- Segment customers using RFM modeling for potential business insights

## 📁 Notebook

The main analysis is in [`sales_analysis_rfm.ipynb`](sales_analysis_rfm.ipynb).

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is not included in this repo due to size/privacy but is easily found by a quick 'UK retail data set' google search.

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- seaborn, matplotlib
- datetime
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Key Insights

- Identified high-value customer segments based on RFM scores
- Found trends in sales frequency and monetary value over time
- Useful for targeting marketing strategies and improving retention

## 💡 Future Work

- Automate segmentation pipeline
- Integrate with a dashboard tool (e.g., Power BI)
- Apply clustering techniques like K-Means to RFM scores
